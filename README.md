# Guide-Space-and-Time

This guide will walk you through the steps necessary to get started with the Space and Time platform, focusing on detailed code examples to help you understand the platform's features and capabilities. We'll cover the basics, including setting up your environment, connecting to the Space and Time platform, executing basic queries, and working with more advanced features.

## 1. Introduction to Space and Time <a name="introduction"></a>

Space and Time is a decentralized data warehouse that allows developers to work with large datasets, perform SQL queries, and integrate blockchain data with traditional datasets. It offers a unique architecture that ensures data integrity and security while providing a scalable solution for data management.

## 2. Setting Up the Environment <a name="setup"></a>

Before you begin, you need to set up your development environment. Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Node.js: Space and Time SDK requires Node.js to run. You can download it from here.

npm or yarn: Package managers to install the Space and Time SDK.

Space and Time SDK: The official SDK for interacting with the Space and Time platform.

### Step 1: Install Node.js and npm

If you haven't already installed Node.js, you can do so by following the instructions on the official website. npm is bundled with Node.js, so it will be installed automatically.

Verify the installation:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

### Step 2: Initialize a New Project

Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

```
mkdir space-and-time-project
cd space-and-time-project
```
Initialize a new Node.js project:

```
npm init -y
```
### Step 3: Install the Space and Time SDK

Install the Space and Time SDK using npm:

```
npm install @spaceandtime/spaceandtime-sdk
```
Alternatively, you can use yarn:

```
yarn add @spaceandtime/spaceandtime-sdk
```
## 3. Connecting to the Space and Time Platform <a name="connection"></a>

To interact with the Space and Time platform, you need to establish a connection. For this, you'll need your API key and other credentials, which you can obtain from the Space and Time dashboard after registering an account.

### Step 1: Import the SDK

In your project, create a new JavaScript file (e.g., index.js), and import the SDK:

```
const { SpaceAndTime } = require('@spaceandtime/spaceandtime-sdk');
```
### Step 2: Initialize the Client

Next, you need to initialize the Space and Time client with your credentials:

```
const spaceAndTime = new SpaceAndTime({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  region: 'YOUR_REGION', // For example, 'us-east-1'
  environment: 'production', // or 'development'
});
```
Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' and 'YOUR_REGION' with your actual API key and region.

### Step 3: Verify the Connection

You can test the connection by making a simple API call, such as retrieving metadata about your account:

```
async function testConnection() {
  try {
    const metadata = await spaceAndTime.getMetadata();
    console.log('Connection successful:', metadata);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error connecting to Space and Time:', error);
  }
}

testConnection();
```
Run the script:

```
node index.js
```
If the connection is successful, you should see metadata printed to the console.

## 4. Executing Basic Queries <a name="basic-queries"></a>

Once connected, you can start executing SQL queries against the Space and Time platform.

### Step 1: Write a Simple Query

Let's start with a simple SQL query to fetch data from a table. Suppose you have a table named customers:

```
async function runQuery() {
  const query = 'SELECT * FROM customers LIMIT 10';

  try {
    const result = await spaceAndTime.query(query);
    console.log('Query result:', result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error executing query:', error);
  }
}

runQuery();
```
This query fetches the first 10 records from the customers table.

### Step 2: Execute the Query

Run the script again:

```
node index.js
```
You should see the query result in the console.

## 5. Working with Data <a name="data-operations"></a>

Besides querying data, the Space and Time platform allows you to insert, update, and delete data.

### Step 1: Inserting Data

You can insert data into a table using an SQL INSERT statement:

```
async function insertData() {
  const query = `
    INSERT INTO customers (id, name, email)
    VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com')
  `;

  try {
    const result = await spaceAndTime.query(query);
    console.log('Insert result:', result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error inserting data:', error);
  }
}

insertData();
```
### Step 2: Updating Data

To update existing data, use the UPDATE statement:

```
async function updateData() {
  const query = `
    UPDATE customers
    SET email = 'john.newemail@example.com'
    WHERE id = 1
  `;

  try {
    const result = await spaceAndTime.query(query);
    console.log('Update result:', result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error updating data:', error);
  }
}

updateData();
```
### Step 3: Deleting Data

To delete data from a table, use the DELETE statement:

```
async function deleteData() {
  const query = `
    DELETE FROM customers
    WHERE id = 1
  `;

  try {
    const result = await spaceAndTime.query(query);
    console.log('Delete result:', result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error deleting data:', error);
  }
}

deleteData();
```
## 6. Advanced Features <a name="advanced-features"></a>

The Space and Time platform also offers advanced features, such as joining tables, aggregations, and working with blockchain data.

### Step 1: Joining Tables

You can join multiple tables in a query. For example, suppose you have a orders table linked to customers by customer_id:

```
async function joinTables() {
  const query = `
    SELECT c.name, o.order_id, o.total_amount
    FROM customers c
    JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
  `;

  try {
    const result = await spaceAndTime.query(query);
    console.log('Join result:', result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error joining tables:', error);
  }
}

joinTables();
```
### Step 2: Aggregating Data

To aggregate data, use SQL functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.:

```
async function aggregateData() {
  const query = `
    SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS order_count, SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
  `;

  try {
    const result = await spaceAndTime.query(query);
    console.log('Aggregation result:', result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error aggregating data:', error);
  }
}

aggregateData();
```
### Step 3: Working with Blockchain Data

Space and Time allows you to integrate and query blockchain data. Here's a basic example of querying blockchain transactions:

```
async function blockchainQuery() {
  const query = `
    SELECT transaction_hash, block_number, value
    FROM blockchain.transactions
    WHERE from_address = '0xYourWalletAddress'
  `;

  try {
    const result = await spaceAndTime.query(query);
    console.log('Blockchain query result:', result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error querying blockchain data:', error);
  }
}

blockchainQuery();
```
## 7. Error Handling and Debugging <a name="error-handling"></a>

When working with Space and Time, it's crucial to implement proper error handling to ensure your application can handle issues gracefully.

### Step 1: Catching Errors

Always use try...catch blocks when executing queries to catch potential errors:

```
async function safeQuery(query) {
  try {
    const result = await spaceAndTime.query(query);
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Query failed:', error.message);
    return null;
  }
}
```
### Step 2: Debugging

Use console.log and console.error statements to debug your code. Additionally, you can use more advanced debugging tools like the Node.js debugger or external logging libraries.
